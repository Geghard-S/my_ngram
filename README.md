Welcome to My Ngram
Task
Create a program which takes strings from the command line and counts the occurence of each character in the string.

Description
Using the fact that chars have an ASCII int mapping, we created an int array with element position equal to the ASCII representation of different chars. Each element in the array was incremented for the number of occurences of a char in the string. At the end, we just looped through the array and outputted any elements that were greater than 0.

Installation
Run 'make' in the command line to create object and binary executable files.

Usage
run ./my_ngram "str1" "str2" ... to analyze string arguments
